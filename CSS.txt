3 types of CSS:
1) Inline (style attribute)
2) Internal (style tag)
3) External

Drawback of inline:
-> Repetation of text
-> Readability

Types of selectors:
1) class Selector
2) ID selector
3) Pseudo Selector
4) Universal Selector(*)

box-sizing: border-box-> This will avoid change in size.
box-sizing: content-box-> This is default mode which changes the size on insertion of padding and margin.

display and position:
3 types of display:
1) block-> will consume 100% width always.
2) inline->will be dependant upon width, will disable height and width
3) inline-block->will consider height and width and shift the content horizontally.

.doc {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: center;//will put the content in between
            align-items:center;//will put the horizontal and vertical space same
        }
flex_wrap:wrap; //will set the amount of containers in one line

For different playscreen we can use media query:
@media(max-width:680){
	//style.css
}

Positions in CSS:
1) static(default)
2) relative
3) absolute
4) fixed
5) stickey

2) relative:
It is used to set the position relative with itself. It can be used to put a specific push to a certain element. We can put top instead of margin-top and so on.

3) Absolute:
It eliminate space provided to it. And it overwrite its right portion. Since it left its position it will move relative to its parent.
Note that the position of the parent must also be either relative or absolute.

4) Fixed:
Works similar to the absolute but It will be fixed to the screen while motion of the screen.

5) Stickey:
Works similar to fixed but in this it will stick only when we scroll it to 0 top and then sticks to the top.

background can be used to set 
background:url('car.jpg')
background-size: percentage
background-repeat:no-repeat
background-positon: center
background-attachment:fixed
background: linear-gradient(degree,yellow,red)
background:radial-gradient(degree,yellow,red)

opacity:(0-1)

overflow: hidden or scroll

Animation:
animation-name:can be used to give names
animation-duration: can be used to give duration
animation-iteration-count: can be used to specify quantity (infiniate)
@keyframes name{
